# Internal validation in -omic datasets for machine learning based cancer predictors

This project investigates the effects of different internal validation methods on the performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers trained on epigenomic and transcriptomic data. Using publicly available datasets to develop classifiers that can distinguish between healthy vs. cancer states, the aim is to evaluate how internal validation choices influence model performance and generalisability. The overall goal is to determine the most appropriate bioinformatics approach for cancer detection models using molecular biomarkers.
